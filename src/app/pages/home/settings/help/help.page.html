    <p>
      Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in
      animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause
      respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe
      diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus
      causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
    </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">What is COVID-19?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough.
      Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore
      throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
      Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel
      unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing
      special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
      becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
      those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart
      problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People
      with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.
    </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">How does COVID-19 spread?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can
      spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth
      which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These
      droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then
      catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their
      eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in
      droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.
      This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
      person who is sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will
      continue to share updated findings.
    </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">
    Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
  </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
      transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through
      the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”
    </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">
    Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
  </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled
      by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone
      with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19
      experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early
      stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from
      someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. WHO
      is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19
      and will continue to share updated findings.
    </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">
    Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?
  </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears
      to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present
      in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of
      the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is
      spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk,
      however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the
      bathroom and before eating

    <p>Protection measures for everyone</p>
    <p>
      Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available
      on the WHO website and through your national and local public health
      authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and
      several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
      have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the
      situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by
      taking some simple precautions:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub
        or wash them with soap and water.<br />
        Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand
        rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
      </li>
      <li>
        Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone
        who is coughing or sneezing.<br />
        Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets
        from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close,
        you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the
        person coughing has the disease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.<br />
        Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once
        contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth.
        From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory
        hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or
        tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue
        immediately.<br />
        Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you
        protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and
        COVID-19.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty
        breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the
        directions of your local health authority.<br />
        Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
        information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow
        your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health
        facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses
        and other infections.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas
        where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to
        places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart
        or lung disease.<br />
        Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these
        areas.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
      14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading
    </p>
    <p>Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for everyone)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with
        mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and
        slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have
        someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a
        mask to avoid infecting other people.<br />
        Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will
        allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you
        and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
        advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other
        serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent
        travel or contact with travelers.<br />
        Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly
        direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent
        possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">How likely am I to catch COVID-19?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there
      is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still
        low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas)
        where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these
        areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health
        authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19
        is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel,
        movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts
        will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.
      </li>
      <li>
        COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained, and transmission stopped, as has
        been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new
        outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It&rsquo;s important to be aware of the
        situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on
        the COVID-19 situation worldwide.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Should I worry about COVID-19?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <ol>
      <li>
        Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for
        children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about
        1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore
        quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will
        affect them and their loved ones.
      </li>
      <li>
        We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved
        ones and our communities. First and foremost, among these actions is
        regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene.
        Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health
        authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement
        and gatherings.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">
    Who is at risk of developing severe illness?
  </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older
      persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high
      blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to
      develop serious illness more often than others.
    </p>
    <p>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?</p>
    <p>
      No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial
      infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.
      Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of
      COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a
      bacterial infection.
    </p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">
    Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?
  </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and
      alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine
      can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication
      with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for
      COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include
      both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide
      updated information as soon as clinical findings are available.
    </p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">
    Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?
  </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine
      to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive
      care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be
      hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under
      investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is
      coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and
      treat COVID-19.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19
      are frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow
      or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from
      people who are coughing or sneezing. (See Basic protective measures
      against the new coronavirus).
    </p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other
      genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.
    </p>
    <p>
      SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have
      been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.
    </p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Should I wear a mask to protect myself?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially
      coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face
      mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone
      who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of
      masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of
      precious resources and mis-use of masks (see Advice on the use of masks).

      </li>
      <li>
        Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or
        soap and water
      </li>
      <li>Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.</li>
      <li>Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).</li>
      <li>
        Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the
        mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pull down the mask&rsquo;s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.
      </li>
      <li>
        After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the
        ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid
        touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.
      </li>
      <li>Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.</li>
      <li>
        Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use
        alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap
        and water.

      The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and
      beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the

      Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals.
      Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread
      to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and
      MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of
      COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid
      direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure
      good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal

      that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19
      virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This
      may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or

      infections, have the right to high quality care before, during and after
      childbirth. This includes antenatal, newborn, postnatal, intrapartum and
      mental health care.
    </p>
    <p>A safe and positive childbirth experience includes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Being treated with respect and dignity.</li>
      <li>Having a companion of choice present during delivery.</li>
      <li>Clear communication by maternity staff.</li>
      <li>
        Appropriate pain relief strategies: Mobility in labour where possible,
        and birth position of choice.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, health workers should take all
      appropriate precautions to reduce risks of infection to themselves and
      others, including hand hygiene, and appropriate use of protective clothing
      like gloves, gown and medical mask.

    <p>
      The mode of birth should be individualized and based on a woman’s
      preferences alongside obstetric indications.
